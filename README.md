## Generating random numbers using radio static and a microphone
In this repository, you will find all files and scripts we used to build a [TRNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20hardware%20random,by%20means%20of%20an%20algorithm.) using a radio and a microphone.
The microphone records static generated by the radio. We also implemented a REST interface designed to turn the radio on/off and return generated numbers encoded in a hexadecimal format.

## Requirements
- At least [Python version 3.9.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/)
- IDE of your choice that can run Python
- A radio
- A microphone (preferably with 44.100 Hertz and no filtering of background noise)

# Image requirements
- Image file which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oNryLc5xD-iDy7fwh5PK_4DDmVyCYkt0/view?usp=sharing)
- SD card with atleast 8GB of storage
- Software to flash the image, for instance balenaEtcher
